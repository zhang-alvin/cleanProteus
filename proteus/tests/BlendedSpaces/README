* To run the code type "parun -l5 -v hpFEM_p.py hpFEM_n.py"
* To choose the different problems in the paper edit hpFEM.py as follows:
  +PROBLEM_TYPE. Choose 0,1,2 for 2D Poisson, adv-diff and anisotropic diff.
  +AUTOMATED_ALPHA. Choose 0,1 for alpha_h via ad-hoc or automated function.
  +ALPHA_FOR_GALERKIN. Choose 0,1 for Galerkin solution based on u^L or u^H.
* For PROBLEM_TYPE=0 choose the refinement level by running as follows:
  + parun -l5 -v hpFEM_p.py hpFEM_n.py -C "refinement=X"
    (where X is the refinement level)
